# Nuxt 3 x Docker template

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️

Nuxt 3 is still in development, therefore it is not recommended for use in production, and **neither is this project**. I am not a member of Nuxt/Docker development team or associated with it in any other way. More detailed (ie. Docker-oriented) instructions coming soon.

We recommend to look at the [documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org).

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/deployment).
